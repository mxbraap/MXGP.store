/**
 * "Blank Canvas" — the build-from-scratch DesignPack.
 *
 * Not a design — a STARTING POINT. The pack ships deliberately bare files
 * (homepage.tsx + chrome.tsx, heavily commented) that an AI coding agent (or
 * a developer) rewrites into a completely unique site: own header, own
 * footer, own every page — while ALL backend (DB, cart, checkout, admin,
 * auth, AI tools, SEO/JSON-LD) keeps working untouched.
 *
 * The customer-facing path: tell your AI agent
 *   "Build me a completely new design: edit designs/blank/* — header,
 *    footer, homepage, all content unique. Set it live with
 *    designSlug: 'blank' (brand.config.ts) or via /admin/designs."
 * Full guide: AGENTS.md → "Blank canvas — build a design from scratch",
 * plus the in-file guides in homepage.tsx and chrome.tsx.
 *
 * Design decisions (deliberate — keep when rewriting the LOOK, not the docs):
 * - mode "both": selectable in website AND webshop mode (the picker keeps
 *   "both" designs visible either way; webshop pages render their default
 *   token-adaptive bodies until you add `webshop` overrides).
 * - applyPaletteAsTheme + a neutral grayscale palette: if you change nothing,
 *   every built-in surface (cart/checkout/account/contact) renders clean
 *   monochrome instead of the engine's default purple — a true blank slate.
 *   A shop's themeJson palette still wins if set.
 *
 * Building a contact form, calculator or quote wizard in this pack? POST it to
 * the endpoint that already exists — `POST /api/inquiries` writes a `Lead` row
 * and `/admin/leads` is its inbox. Send `source` (which form) and `data` (an
 * object of whatever you collected) so a bespoke form's answers are kept; keys
 * outside `data` are stripped. See AGENTS.md → "Capturing leads".
 * - mixable: false (via designs/options.ts MIXABLE_DESIGN_SLUGS, where blank
 *   is intentionally absent): the bare markup is token-free, so cw-* Mixer
 *   Parts would not visually cohere with whatever you build here. If your
 *   rewrite paints everything with cw-* token chains, you can flip this by
 *   adding "blank" to MIXABLE_DESIGN_SLUGS.
